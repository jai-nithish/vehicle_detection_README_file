# Vehicle Detection Based On Adaptive Multimodal Feature Fusion And Cross-modal Vehicle Index Using RGB-T Images (2023 - 2024)

## Overview

This project implements a vehicle detection system leveraging adaptive multimodal feature fusion and cross-modal vehicle indexing. By using RGB and Thermal (RGB-T) images, the system aims to improve detection accuracy in challenging environments.

## System Architecture

The system follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the RGB and Thermal images for feature extraction.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract significant features from the images.
3. **Data Splitting**: Divides the processed data into training and testing datasets.
4. **Classification**: A CNN model classifies the images to detect the presence of vehicles.
5. **Prediction**: The model predicts the presence of vehicles in new images.
6. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates the model using metrics like accuracy, loss, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Anaconda:
   ```bash
   conda create --name vehicle-detection python=3.8
   conda activate vehicle-detection
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, modify the `config.yaml` file with your training parameters and run:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Testing

To evaluate the model on the test dataset, use:
```bash
python test.py
```

## Results

The system's performance is analyzed through various metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Loss**: Reflects the model's error during training.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
